Catalog Error: Ambiguity detected for 'dt': this could either refer to the 'Table' 'dt', or the attached catalog 'dt' which has a default table. To avoid this error, either detach the catalog and reattach under a different name, or use a fully qualified name for the 'Table': 'memory.main.dt' or for the Catalog Default Table: 'dt.main.dt'.
